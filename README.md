# Customer_Churn_Telecom_Project
For Telco companies, it is key to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations (=churn) to grow their revenue-generating base. Looking at churn, different reasons trigger customers to terminate their contracts, for example, better price offers, more attractive packages, bad service experiences or changes in customersâ€™ situations.&lt;br>&lt;/br> Churn analytics provides valuable capabilities to predict customer churn and also define the underlying reasons that drive it. The churn metric is mostly shown as the percentage of customers that cancel a product or service within a given period (mostly months). Suppose a Telco company had 10 Mio. customers on the 1st of January and received 500K contract terminations until the 31st of January; the monthly churn for January would be 5%.
